My first Python project(in github) that takes numbers from the user and shows which one is the biggest. I used loops and if-else statements. Good practice for learning inputs and lists!
# My First Python Project

👋 Hi everyone!
This is my first Python project. It's a simple program that takes numbers from the user and finds the largest one.
## Why I wrote this?
I had to submit a project for my programming class. The teacher said we could write anything we wanted. So I decided to write a simple program that finds the largest number.
## How does it work?
First, it asks how many numbers you want to enter. Then it takes that many numbers and finally tells you which one is the largest.
